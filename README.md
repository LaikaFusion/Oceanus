# Oceanus

A public open-source API that delivers information of the creatures dwelling in the sea

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

* [node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)


### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Open your terminal on the root of the project and run the yarn command to install all the node packages.

```
yarn
```

2. Create in the root of the project a file called .env and write this inside the document

```
BASE_ROUTE=http://localhost:3000
```

## Running the tests

Coming soon...

## Deployment

### Running the server in a production environment

The package.json has a script called server that you can run using:

```
yarn server
```

This will run the API using node and mantain it live.

### Running the server in a local environment for tests

The package.json has another command called test-server that you can run using:

```
yarn test-server
```

This will run a nodemon server on your localhost:3000 unless you got an environment variable set up.
