    craniaAnomala: {
        name: 'Crania anomala',
        description: 'C. anomala is rounded or somewhat squarely orbicular in vertical view, reaching about 15 mm in width. In lateral view, the dorsal valve is conical; the apex subcentral or near the posterior margin. Its surface is usually smooth or finely striate; concentric growth lines are present. It has neither a functional pedicle nor a pedicle opening; instead, the flattened ventral valve is cemented to the substratum. Its colour is very variable, the periostracum being dark brown or reddish, while the ventral valve is light grey. The shell is endopunctate. The valves are gaping in life, with approximately 60 non-retractile setae projecting in each anterio-lateral crescent.',

        distribution: 'In the North Sea, the species occurs off Scotland and Shetlands. Elsewhere it is found from the Arctic to the Canary Islands.'

The pedicle foramen is circular, and the deltidial plates unite medianly. ',

        name: 'Glaciarcula spitzbergensis',
        description: 'The shell is circular or oval in outline, and reaches a maximum length of approx. 10 mm. The external surfaces are smooth except for fine concentric growth lines. The shell is endopunctate and yellowish-white in colour. The pedicle foramen is elongate, and the deltidial plates do not join medianly. The ventral umbo is slightly incurved.',
        habitat: 'In British waters it is found in depths between 70 and 700 metres.',

        name: 'Gwynia capsula',
        description: 'Shell minute, ovate and globose, rounded anteriorly, longer than wide, broadest anteriorly; with a maximum length of 1.5 mm. The external surfaces are smooth save for faint concentric growth lines. It is white or yellowish in colour with large and well-spaced punctae. Dorsal valve convex, its posterior margin nearly straight. Ventral valve as deep, convex, with a slight umbo. The deltidial plates are small and do not join medianly; the pedicle foramen is relatively large and incomplete.',

The colour varies from dark bluish to a variety of shades of grey and brown. Sulcation of the anterior commissure occurs only in specimens more than about 16 mm long. Shell without punctae. The pedicle foramen is elongated and the ventral umbo is produced as a curved beak.',
        habitat: 'It has been collected at depths from 15 to 1100 metres.',
