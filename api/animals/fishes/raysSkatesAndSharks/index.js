Polli and the holotype of P. atlanticus (a female) is slightly larger (44 cm) than the largest reported G. polli. Garman (1913) synonymized P. atlanticus with G. melastomus, but the validity of this action is questionable pending a reexamination of the type of P. atlanticus, MNHN 84-387.`,

        remarks: `See Bass, D'Aubrey and Kistnasamy (1975a) for a discussion of the synonymy of this species. These writers note that although the holotype and three of the four paratypes of Scyliorhinus (Halaelurus) melanostiqma Norman, 1939, collected off Zanzibar and in the British Museum (Natural History) marine fish collection, are based on specimens of H. regani, the fourth paratype (BMNH 1939.5.24.5, a 210 mm female) is punctatus-like. This Zanzibar specimen differs from Natal Dunctatus in having a single narrow dark bar flanked by light lines on its dorsal fins (Natal specimens have twin V-marks on their dorsals). The writer was able to examine two additional specimens of this type from Tanzania, collected by G. Bianchi in1982, and can confirm the colour differences. Additionally, these sharks agree with H. regani and not H. punctatus in having enlarged denticles interspersed with normal smaller ones, but have the shorter anal fin, small size, and general colour pattern of H. punctatus. As suggested by Bass, D'Aubrey and Kistnasamy, these Tanzanian sharks may represent an additional, undescribed species or a geographic variant of H. punctatus, but unfortunately there are no specimens from the intermediate area, northern Mozambique, to determine if the Natal-southern Mozambique and Tanzanian punctatus types intergrade or not. Springer (1979) reported a similar specimen from Tanzania (a 210 mm immature male, possibly not saved).`,

The heavy hypercalcification of the skeleton of adults of this species is uniquein its genus and family, although other carcharhinoids have hypercalcified skeletons (see Compagno, 1979). With present evidence (Heemstra, 1973, pers. comm.), there seem to be isolated populations of this species off Natal, South Africa (the Mustelus species of Bass, D'Aubrey and Kistnasamy, 1975a, which Dr P.C. Heemstra identifies as M. mosis and which the writer has examined and skeletonized) in the Red Sea, and in the "Gulf" and Arabian Sea to southern India and Sri Lanka, though this may be an illusion of inadequate collecting. The writer examined a specimen labelled M. manazo in the Zoological Survey of India, illustrated by Day (1878), and found it to be M. mosis. A. Baranes of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem has done a study of the ecology and behaviour of this species in the Red Sea off Elat, Israel. In Israeli waters off Elat it is called the Moses smooth-hound and off South Africa, the hardnose smooth-hound.`,
