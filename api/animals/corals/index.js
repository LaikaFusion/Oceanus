        corallites: `Corallite diameter 1.9-2.5 mm, with 17-36 septa per corallite. Columella present, trabecular and discontinuous.`,
        habitat: `Inhabit sloping reef faces, under ledge overhangs and along walls, till depths of 60 meters.`,
        distribution: `Occasional Florida, Bahamas, Caribbean and Brazil.`

    fusedStaghornCoral: {
        id: 30,
        name: `Fused staghorn coral (Acropora prolifera)`,
        description: `Colony branched, but the branches fused at crossings or parallel branches sometimes fused at considerable distance. Tips of branches with strong axial corallites; radial corallites orientated upwards, in rows. Colony up to 1.2 meter; branch diameter between 0.5 and 2 cm.`,
        color: `Brown to yellow-brown, with a white axial corallite.`,
        corallites: `Corallites are porous protruding tubes, less than 5 mm long, and 0.8-1.0 mm in diameter. They are densely packed, with 2-3 mm in between. A columella is absent.`,
        habitat: `Occurring well below the surface, but not deeper than about 10 meters. In shallow water only in quiet bays and the lee side of islands. Generally not in inner bays.`,
        distribution: `Uncommon South Florida, Bahamas and Caribbean.`,
        remarks: `Recent DNA sequence analyses suggested that Acropora prolifera is a hybrid between Acropora cervicornis and Acropora palmata , which backcrosses with the parental species at low frequency.`

    giantSlitPoreSeaRod: {
        id: 31,
        name: `Giant slit-pore sea rod (Plexaurella nutans)`,
        description: `Colonies very tall with thick stalks and sparse, dichotomous branching; up to 1.3 m in height. End branches thick, 10-15 mm in diameter, and can be very long, up to 1 m. The ends of the branches are usually club-shaped. Apertures widely spaced and each is usually elevated on a small mound. The apertures are 2-2.5 mm in diameter and range from nearly circular to slit like in shape.`,
        color: `Pale gray to tan or light brown.`,
        habitat: `Inhabit patch and fore reefs in clear waters.`,
        distribution: `Common to occasional Florida, Bahamas and Caribbean.`

    goldenZoanthid: {
        id: 32,
        name: `Golden zoanthid (Parazoanthus swiftii)`,
        description: `This colonial zoanthid is symbiotic and grows in band-like rows, often winding around the branches of the host sponge. The oral disc is up to 0.6 cm in diameter and is fringed by up to 26 long and thinly tentacles.`,
        color: `Body brilliant gold to yellow; tentacles pale yellow.`,
        habitat: `Symbiotic on a wide variety of sponges, including the Brown tube sponge (Agelas conifera ), the Green finger sponge (Iotrochota birotulata ) and Topsentia ophiraphidites (P. swifti on T. ophiraphidites). The zoanthids are toxic to fish and may discourage sponge-eating fishes from sampling their hosts; the distinctive color of the zoanthid on the sponges may serve to advertise their presence.`,
        distribution: `Common Bahamas and Caribbean.`
