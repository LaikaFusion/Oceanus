    acanthomysisLongicornis: {
        name: `Acanthomysis longicornis`,
        description: `Generic features: Statocyst usually present. Carpo-propodus divided into 6-8 subsegments. Pleopods of male rudimentary; fourth with a very long exopod armed with "pincer" setae. Apex of antennal scale rounded. No sternal processes. Antennal scale with rounded apex. Endopod (and exopod) of uropod without spines. Outer margin of antennal scale with setae; terminal tooth absent. Telson linguiform; lateral margins of telson and apex armed with a graduated series of spines and a pair of median setae. Species: General appearance is long and slender with the abdomen nearly straight. Antennule with very long peduncle, second segment small, distal segment swollen and almost equal in length to the first. Antennal scale extending only slightly beyond the antennular peduncle, narrowly lanceolate with rounded apex, about eight times as long as broad, with an oblique suture cutting off the terminal portion. Eyes large and pyriform, somewhat widely separated and projecting considerably beyond the lateral margins of the carapace, eyestalk stout and hispid. Thoracic limbs with propodite usually three-segmented, the proximal one the longest, merus subequal in length to the carpus, nail distinct, long and very slender. Pleopods similar to those in the genus Neomysis. Fourth pleopod of the male reaching to the middle of the last abdominal somite, exopod two-segmented, with the first segment about seven times as long as the second, which terminates in two long, unequal, spinous setae of which the longer is twice as long as the segment. Telson elongate, entire, widely dilated at the base and then suddenly constricted with the distal portion linguiform, apex bluntly rounded, proximal margin armed in the region of the constriction with two spines on each side, posterior two-thirds of margin and apex densely armed with numerous, unequal spines arranged in series, with larger spines separated by series of three, four or five smaller ones gradually increasing in size distally. Apex with two small central spines clanked by two larger ones. These spines arming the telson are somewhat peculiar. The external sheath of the spine is suddenly thickened towards the distal end, reducing the lumen in such a way as to present the appearance of an axial line. This has led some observers to think that the tip of the spine was trigonal. Uropods with endopod nearly equal in length to the telson, swollen at the base and narrowing sharply distally, inner margin armed in the region of the statocyst with a row of very small spines, of which the distal two or three are considerably larger than the others; exopod long and narrow, one and a half times as long as the endopod. Pigment blackish brown, sparse.`,
        colour: `Blackish brown, sparse.`,
        size: `Adult up to 9 mm long.`,
        depthRange: `Hyperbenthic; from 8 to 150 m. Acanthomysis longicornis is a filter-feeder, living on very minute organisms and on detritus.`,
        distributionInTheNorthSea: `Southwestern North Sea.`,
        worldDistribution: `Atlantic < 26-55°N, Mediterranean, Indo-W Pacific; coastal to shelf. Widely distributed in the waters of the Mediterranean and off the shores of west Europe as far as north as the British Isles`

    amblyopsAbbreviata: {
        name: `Amblyops abbreviata`,
        description: `Species: Body somewhat robust. Carapace large and deeply produced laterally; cephalic region slightly inflated; anterior margin broadly rounded without rostral projection. Posterior border emarginate leaving most of the last thoracic somite exposed in dorsal view. Eyes rudimentary in the form of two large, separate, rhomboidal plates. Antennular peduncle short and robust, outer distal corner of first segment produced as in the Genus Erythrops and tipped with three of four plumose setae; middle segment very short; Antennal peduncle slightly shorter than the antennular peduncle and much more slender, four-segmented, with the second short and bent upward from the plane of the first segment; third swollen, overhanging the second segment and bent downward from it so that in lateral view the peduncle has a peculiar distorted appearance.

    amblyopsKempi: {
       name: `Amblyops kempi`,
       description: `Generic features: Statocyst usually present. Pleopods of female reduced, rudimentary; of male variable. Endopod (and exopod) of uropod without spines. Outer margin of antennal scale without setae; ending in terminal tooth. Eyeplates quadrangular, outer corners rounded, margins not serrulated. Eyes often rudimentary in the form of flat plates without definite stalks. Telson rounded. Lateral margins of telson and apex armed with a graduated series of spines and a pair of median setae. Marsupium consists, as in the Genus Pseudomma, of two well-developed incubatory brood lamellae. Species: Body somewhat robust. Carapace slightly wider than the abdomen, anterior margin rounded to a bluntly rounded, very obtuse angle, cervical sulcus well marked, posterior margin emarginate. Eyes in the form of completely separated, broadly oblong, ocular plates; surface armed sparsely with minute spinules which are more dense and pronounced in the antero-lateral region; in larger specimens the plate is drawn out into a distinct lobe near the antero-distal angle. Antennal peduncle relatively short, equal in length to the antennular peduncle. First segment imperfectly divided, second segment overhanging the first dorsally making the peduncle appear distorted, especially in lateral view. Antennular scale about twice as long as the peduncle, tapering slightly towards the apex, with the widest part about one-third of the length of the scale from its proximal end; outer margin slightly convex, terminating in a prominent spine which extends beyond the apex of the scale and which may be armed with a small secondary spine on its inner margin; very large spine on the outer distal angle of the sympod. Uropod long and slender. Exopod more than one and a half times as long as the telson. Endopod shorter and more slender, usually armed with a single, long slender spine on the inner margin in the region of the statocyst. Telson equal in length to the last abdominal somite, narrowed abruptly close to the base, tapering very slightly to the broadly rounded, entire apex; apex armed with a median pair of minute spinules and two pairs of long slender spines which form the culmination of an evenly graduated series of 27-28 spines arming each lateral margin; a pair of plumose setae present above the median spinules.`,
       colour: `Similar to Amblyops abbreviata: anterior portion of body transparent and colourless except for the eyeplates which are covered with very minute red specks of pigment and appear rosy red in colour. The large gut shows through the integument as a reddish mass and the yellow liver is also cleurly visible. The abdomen is sparsely covered with minute, evenly distributed, red specks.`,
       size: `Length of both sexes up to 16 mm.`,
       depthRange: `Hyperbenthic, bathypelagic. The species occurs just clear of the bottom in depths of 700-1500 m. It is most abundant between 1100-1500 m.`,
       remarks: `Amblyops kempi can be distinguished from Amblyops abbreviata by: the presence of spinules all over the eyeplates, the particularly large spine on the basal joint of the antenna, the long slender spines on the endopod of the uropod and,  the shape and armature of the telson. Amblyops kempi is evidently a deeper water form than Amblyops abbreviata, but there is still overlap in the distributions of the two species. Amblyops kempi lives close to the sea bottom making only short occasional excursions into the lower levels of water just above the floor.`,
       distributionInTheNorthSea: `Probably rarae in the northern North Sea.`,

    anchialinaAgilis: {
        name: `Anchialina agilis`,
        description: `Generic features: General form compact and robust. Carpus large. Propodus divided into two to three subsegments. Posterior margin of carapace transverse. Integument covered with very small bristles or tiny spinules which are particularly noticeable on the dorsal surface of the telson and on the large basal segments of the appendages. Pleural plates of first abdominal somite only slightly produced. Eyes large with thick short eyestalks. Telson very long with small apical cleft. Male pleopods biramous well developed, natatory, third pair with exopod slightly elongated. Spines on outer margin of exopod of uropod small; large spines on distal portions of inner margin of endopod. Species: Carapace large, covering the whole of the thorax and more than half the first abdominal somite in dorsal view, widening considerably posteriorly, posterior margin straight and transverse. Rostrum large, narrowly biangular, covering part of the bases of the antennular peduncles, the anterior tip is usually bent downward between the antennules and so appears to be shorter than it really is. Antennular peduncle in both sexes short and thick, first segment only slightly longer than the eyes, second segment very short and hollowed out at its anterior- end forming a kind of basin in which the third segment rests; inner margins of second and third segments in the male armed with a few long plumose setae. Antennal scale very small, extending only slightly beyond the first segment of the antennular peduncle, outer margin naked, terminating in a small spine beyond which the apex extends considerably, small distal suture present.

Labrum produced anteriorly into a long spine serrated along the margins. First thoracic limb larger in the male than in the female, without lobes, dactylus small, bearing a long, strong, curved nail, very large axe-shaped vibratory lamella in both sexes. Second thoracic limb short, basal segment large, carpus in the male enlarged irregularly along its inner and distal margins. Third thoracic limb basal joint large, carpus distinct, propodus divided at distal end by two or three transverse articulations, dactylus very small, without nail. distal end of limb in the male furnished with seven long, strapshaped appendages with oblique markings. Eighth thoracic limb, carpus long armed with setae and with three or four strong barbed spines at the distal end; propodus divided into four subsegments armed with strong barbed spines; genital appendix in the male large, armed with ovate, long setae. Pleopods in the male well developed, natatory, biramous (except the first pair in which the endopod is lacking), large oval pseudobranchial lamella borne at the base of endopod; third pair (not the fourth as described by Sars, 1877, P. 86) with exopod much longer than endopod and its distal segments and their setae modified; fourth pair with exopod longer than endopod but not modified. Pleopods in the female, first pair small, reduced to a simple stiliform segment. The remaining pairs are reduced to very delicate lamellae attached side by side to the posterior ventral margin of the somite and projecting backwards. The free distal margin is angular and bears a few plumose setae with two or three small spines. Telson very long, nearly half as long as the whole abdomen, three times as long as broad at the base; lateral margins straight, armed with 25-30 closely set, plumose spines, terminal ones much larger than the rest, cleft small, about one-seventh of the length of the telson, armed with a close row of about 25 teeth on each side. Apex of each lobe armed with a strong spine. Uropods with endopod longer than exopod, bowed inward at its distal end, inner margin armed with a graduated row of large plumose spines with small spines closely set between them. The two strong spines arming the distal end are very characteristic of the species, statocyst small; exopod with outer margin naked proximally, then armed with a close regular row of spines of which the distal ones are larger and may be slightly plumose.`,
        size: `Adult males up to 9 mm, females 7-8 mm long.`,
        depthRange: `Hyperbenthic, coastal to upper slope. A. agilis is found as a rule at or near to the bottom during daylight but it is capable of very rapid movement from one layer of water to another and can also be taken at the surface and in varying depths during the day. It has not been taken in depths of more than 85 m, but has been collected at the surface and in mid-water over 150 m in Irish waters. It has been most frequently taken at the surface at midnight when it occurs in large numbers.`,
        remarks: `This species can easily be recognised by the robust compact form and large carapace with transverse posterior margin; the large serrated spine at the base of the antennal peduncle; the very small antennal scale; the swollen carpal segment in the second thoracic leg in the male; the peculiar appendages borne at the distal end of the endopod of the third thoracic limb in the male, the small epimeral plates of the first abdominal somite and the very unusual modified pleopods of the second to the fifth somites in the female; the armature and proportions of the uropods with the inward curve of the endopod and the large telson with its small cleft.`,

Distribution includes the North Atlantic quite similar to that of Boreomysis tridens , namely, in boreal waters extending southwards on the eastern slope from Norway to the Bay of Biscay and on the American side from West Greenland to the coasts of New England. In addition, however, it is known from the Mediterranean and from the North Pacific in the Bering Sea, off Japan and off the Coasts of California. Its geographical range (E North Atlantic 28-79°N, Mediterranean, North Pacific; shelf, slope) is thus wider than that of Boreomysis tridens.`
