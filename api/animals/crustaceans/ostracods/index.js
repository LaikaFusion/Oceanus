The rostrum small and, in ventral aspect, hidden by the swollen anterior margin of the carapace.

Female carapace tapers anteriorly with maximum height at two-thirds the length (A. cucullata Habitus 1). Dorsal and ventral carapace margins almost parallel in male (A. cucullata Habitus 3). The unequal rostra are straight and produced anteriorly, left larger, nearly quarter the carapace length. Both valves with pointed processes on posterior margin. Process on left valve located just below postero-dorsal corner; process on right valve longer and positioned slightly more ventrally. Clear and distinctive sculpturing of parallel striae run in differing directions on dorsal third of carapace to the ventral two-thirds. Striae end in spines along ventral margin from the postero-dorsal spine to about where the ventral edge reaches the point of maximum height. Frontal organ long and thin in both sexes; it is half as long again as the limb of the first antenna (A. cucullata 1, A. cucullata 3).`,
        remarks: `Poulsen, 1969a noted the existence of two size forms; this is confirmed by Discovery Collections material. These different size forms are probably distinct species. Smaller species (A. cucullata Habitus 5) are more abundant and sometimes sub-dominant at deep mesopelagic depths at lower latitudes. Larger sensu stricto form (Brady, 1902 described its length as being 2.5mm) is the more common in UK waters. Sampling at abyssopelagic depths reveals taxonomic uncertainties; at least two further species have been taken. one in UK waters (see A. aff. cucullata (Archiconchoecia aff. cucullata)). The strikingly different carapace morphology and mandibular teeth of these species compared with other Archiconchoecia species may segregate them generically.`,
        distribution: `Occurs in all oceans between 60°N-50°S. 1, 2, 3 (R.R.S. Discovery Map). Where the two forms co-occur, the smaller species has the shallower bathymetric range. In UK waters larger form reasonably abundant at 600-1500m.`,

The males are very much shorter and the straight region of the ventral margin is inclined so that the carapace tapers strongly posteriorly (A. gastrodes Habitus 3). In neither sex can the rostrum be seen in ventral aspect (A. gastrodes Habitus 2, A. gastrodes Habitus 4).

        remarks: `Other than the cucullata group with their strong sculpturing and carapace processes, the only Archiconchoecia species which are as large as this species are A. bifurcata and A. poulseni. It differs from the latter in having eight rather than seven claw setae on the caudal furca, and from the former by the carapace height being less than half the length (in A. bifurcata the height is almost 60% of the length). Deevey, 1978a describes other differences related to the second antenna and the setation of the fifth and sixth limbs. Neither of these similar species have been taken in UK waters.`,

Flanks curve almost symmetrically (A. ventricosa Habitus 2, A. ventricosa Habitus 4). The frontal organ in North Eastern Atlantic specimens just longer than limb of the first antenna (A. ventricosa 1, A. ventricosa 3); sometimes terminating in a long tapering point. First antennae bent so spinous seta on the end of the second segment appears to be almost terminal. Sensory setae broad, thin-walled and recurved. A characteristic feature is the unusual length of one of the terminal setae of the sixth limb; it is double the length of the other terminal setae and almost equal to whole limb.

The posterior spines are positioned slightly lower on the posterior margin and their bases overlap. Between the end of the hinge and the righthand process the postero-dorsal margin is smooth.

        distribution: `Widely distributed in all the major oceans. Its poleward limit 62°N 44°S seems to be related to the polar fronts in the various oceans. Its bathymetric range is 700-1500m in the North Atlantic i.e., deep mesopelagic/shallow bathypelagic. 1, 2, 3, 4 (R.R.S. Discovery Map).`,
