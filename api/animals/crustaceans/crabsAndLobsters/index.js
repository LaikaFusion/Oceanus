        id: 5,
        name: `American Spider crab (Pyromaia tuberculata)`,
        description: `The entire animal is covered with short hairs, but in full-grown specimens, the carapace and chelipeds are naked and their surfaces glossy. The carapace is pyriform, rounded in its posterior half and narrowed in its anterior half. The rostrum is projecting into a single process and its tip rounded. The gastric region is convex, marked with a tubercle of a good size in the middle portion, around which several smaller tubercles are found. This median large tubercle is sometimes divided into two. The cardiac region is also convex, marked with a large tubercle in the middle portion, around which a few smaller tubercles are found. The intestinal region is not much convex, with a large tubercle in its posterior portion. In the female, this intestinal tubercle is usually wanting. The hepatic region is small, no dorsal tubercles besides a few tiny ones; its lateral margin is marked with three or four tubercles, anterior one of which is a little larger. The branchial region is dorsally marked with about 30 tubercles, on the upper inner surface, the tubercles form a group forming obscurely oblique rows. The margin of this region is marked with a series of eight or nine tubercles, three or four of which are larger. The number and arrangement of the tubercles on these regions are individually variable. No specific differences between Japanese and California specimens can be seen in regard to the feature of carapace as well as in the number and arrangement of tubercles. The supraorbital eave is well defined, marked with a tubercle of a good size at its anterior end; this large tubercle is obliterated in female or younger specimens. The basal antennal segment is armed with a strong tooth at its antero-external angle, the form and size of this tooth are almost the same in both Japanese and California forms. The male abdomen is consisted of six segments, the penultimate and terminal segments being fused together. The female abdomen is consisted of five segments, the fifth to seventh segments being fused together. According to Dr. Garth, the male abdomen of Japanese form is narrower and its lateral borders concave, but in most of the specimens before the author, such features are not so remarkable. The female abdomen is more thickly covered with tubercles than in the male. The form of apex of the anterior male pleopod is rather complicated, the outlet of the spermatophore being encircled with thin membrane and edged wall on both outer and inner margins. The appendage of the California specimen was already drawn by Garth (1958 1. c., pl. E, fig. 7). In his figure, however, such thin membrane and edged wall were overlooked. In regard to the form of the anterior pleopod of male, Japanese specimens seem to differ from California forms, while, that of the male from California sent by Dr. Garth is almost agreeing with that of the Japanese specimen, as shown in Text-fig. 3 a, b. The discrepancy seen between Garth's figure and those of the present author probably due to the difference of angle when the pleopod was examined by microscope, and also partly to the difference of growth (?). It is wonderful that the pleopod of Erileptus spinosus Rathbun, figured by Garth in his Pl. E, fig. 8 (loc. cit.) is somewhat resembling that of P. tuberculata from Japan and also from California figured in the present opportunity. The chelipeds are robust. The merus and carpus are marked with a few tubercles on the inner and outer borders. The propodus is thick and its surface smooth; there are a few tubercles, which are arranged in a median longitudinal row on the outer proximal surface, and also a few others near the proximal outer and inner surfaces. The prehensile edges of both fingers are finely denticulated, one or two proximal teeth are a little larger than the others. The ambulatory legs are slender, the first pair is the longest, nearly thrice the entire length of carapace; the last pair is the shortest, half as long as the first pair. The main segments of these legs are distally thickened; no distal or proximal spines or teeth on each segment. The posterior edge of the dactylus is armed with ten to twelve denticles, but in full-grown specimens, these denticles are obliterated. (Sakai, 1971: 144)`,

Its size and the fact that the species lives on trawlable bottoms are in favour of this supposition. Records of commercial catches of M. andamanicus off S.E. Africa and Madagascar refer to M. mozambicus; such records from Australia are actually based on material of M. velutinus.`,

        interestToFisheries: `In E. Australia the species is extensively used as bait for fishing. The so-called yabbie- pumps received their name from the Australia bait collectors, who were the first to use this suction pump for collecting these burrowing animals. As described by Hailstone (1962: 29-30) there are 3 types of yabbie-pumps (also called slurp guns). Two of these types are manual and are "essentially coring tubes, which, when pushed into the sand and extracted, remove a core of about 2 ft. [= about 60 cm] in length and from 2 in. to 4 in. [= 5 to 10 cm] in diameter. Either pump is then reinserted in the hole so formed and suction is applied (with the aid of a plunger in one model or by closing off all air outlets and withdrawal of the pump in the other model). As a results of this suction, water, sand and yabbies are drawn into the hole and removed " (Hailstone, 1962: 30). The third type is motor-driven and "works on the reverse principle, i.e., water under pressure is driven deeply into the sand and yabbies are flooded to the surface". The pump with the plunger is now used extensively in many parts of the world for collecting burrowing Crustacea from sandy or muddy substrates in the intertidal and subtidal zones as described by Manning (1975: 318-319).`,

During the remaining part of the season, the "coastal red" lobsters are fished. The Abrolhos Islands are exceptional as the season starts there on 15 March. The fishing activities are concentrated between 24° and 35°S, and the largest yields are obtained between 28° and 32°S. The fishery operates lobster traps of various design and divers take specimens by hand. Apart from the closed season there are several protective measures: a minimum size limit (cl. 7.5 cm), bag limit for sports fishermen, restriction of the size of the lobster pots, etc. The species marketed fresh, but the greatest percentage is exported as frozen tails.`,

        name: `Banded lobster (Eunephrops manningi)`,
        description: `A medium-sized lobster. Body cylindrical. Carapace with small granules, with a well developed median rostrum armed with lateral teeth, but none on dorsal mid-line, no distinct ventral teeth present, some fine serrations can be present, no longitudinal ridges behind the cervical groove. Without a pair of spines dorsally on carapace behind the cervical groove. Eyes well developed and pigmented. Antennae long and whip-like. Antennal scale small, failing to reach the middle of the penultimate segment of the antennal peduncle. Spine on antennal peduncle near base of anntennal scale. Tail powerful with a well developed tail fan, not conspicuously granular. Abdominal somites without distinct longitudinal median carina, with a single transverse groove, which is interrupted in the middle. First 3 pairs of legs ending in true chelae. First pair long and stout with large, flattened, naked fingers. Second pereiopod with fingers less than 1/3 as long as palm. Third pereiopod with the fingers about 1/5 of the length of the palm.`,
        type: `Type locality: "Florida Straits, 550 m, Silver Bay stat. 2483'" [ = 26°25.5"N 79°O1'W]. Male holotypein USNM no.139626; paratypes in USNM, RMNH.`,
        geographicalDistribution: `Western Atlantic: Florida Straits and northwest of Anguilla.`,
        habitatAndBiology: `Depth range between (393-) 451 and 550 m Substrate: mud.`,
        size: `Maximum total body length about 15 cm, carapace length 4 to 7 cm.`,
        interestToFisheries: `Since so far only three specimens of this species are known, nothing concrete can be said about its fisheries potential. Its size is attractive, but the depth range and low abundance are negative factors.`,

        name: `Banded spiny lobster (Panulirus marginatus)`,
        description: `Antennular plate with two large widely separated spines, with scattered small spinules behind these. Exopod of third maxilliped present, with flagellum. Upper surface abdomen pubescent in grooves only. Transverse groove of abdominal somites with straight margins, not crenulated. Transverse grooves of abdominal somites 2 to 4 join the groove along the anterior margin of the corresponding pleuron. Anterior margin of pleuron abdominal somite two with distinct teeth.`,
        colour: `carapace with yellowish, reddish and brownish colour, not spotted. Abdomen bright to dark purple with a conspicuous transverse yellow band over the middle of each somite. Legs rather uniform in colour, with a few spots, but not streaked. Antennulae rather uniform in colour.`,
        type: `Type locality: "Iles Sandwich" ( = Hawaiian Islands). Type material no longer extant in MP in 1989.`,
        geographicalDistribution: `Only known from the Hawaiian Islands, including Pearl and Hermes Reef, and Laysan Island.`,
        habitatAndBiology: `The species has been reported from depths down to 143 m, but usually in shallow water, in well protected places on a rocky substrate, under rocks and in rock crevices. The animals are nocturnal.`,
        size: `Total body length to 40 cm, carapace length to 12 cm.`,
        interestToFisheries: `Used as food throughout its range. Fished with traps or nets. Also taken by hand, in daytime by diving, at night with lights and spears. Sold fresh in local markets. The 1971 USA fishery statistics indicate a total of 5 725 pounds ( = 2 600 kg) of lobsters caught in the Hawaiian Islands, of which 5 371 pounds in Oahu, 263 pounds in Maui, 70 pounds in Hawaii and 21 pounds in Lanai. Of these slightly more were caught in gill nets (3253 pounds) than in traps (2113 pounds) and 339 pounds were registered as fished by hand. These figures include the catches of P. penicillatus.`,
