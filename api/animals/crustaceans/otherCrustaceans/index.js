Apex of antennal scale rounded. No sternal processes. Antennal scale with rounded apex. Endopod (and exopod) of uropod without spines. Outer margin of antennal scale with setae; terminal tooth absent. Telson linguiform; lateral margins of telson and apex armed with a graduated series of spines and a pair of median setae. Species. General appearance is long and slender with the abdomen nearly straight. Antennule with very long peduncle, second segment small, distal segment swollen and almost equal in length to the first. Antennal scale extending only slightly beyond the antennular peduncle, narrowly lanceolate with rounded apex, about eight times as long as broad, with an oblique suture cutting off the terminal portion. Eyes large and pyriform, somewhat widely separated and projecting considerably beyond the lateral margins of the carapace, eyestalk stout and hispid. Thoracic limbs with propodite usually three-segmented, the proximal one the longest, merus subequal in length to the carpus, nail distinct, long and very slender. Pleopods similar to those in the genus Neomysis. Fourth pleopod of the male reaching to the middle of the last abdominal somite, exopod two-segmented, with the first segment about seven times as long as the second, which terminates in two long, unequal, spinous setae of which the longer is twice as long as the segment Telson elongate, entire, widely dilated at the base and then suddenly constricted with the distal portion linguiform, apex bluntly rounded, proximal margin armed in the region of the constriction with two spines on each side, posterior two-thirds of margin and apex densely armed with numerous, unequal spines arranged in series, with larger spines separated by series of three, four or five smaller ones gradually increasing in size distally. Apex with two small central spines clanked by two larger ones. These spines arming the telson are somewhat peculiar. The external sheath of the spine is suddenly thickened towards the distal end, reducing the lumen in such a way as to present the appearance of an axial line. This has led some observers to think that the tip of the spine was trigonal.
